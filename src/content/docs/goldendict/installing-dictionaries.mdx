import settingsImage from "@assets/dictionaries-settings.png";

- Put all your dictionary files in one single folder.<br />
  (I personally gather them in `Documents/GoldenDict`)

- Launch GoldenDict

- Click on `Edit > Dictionaries` or press `F3`

- In `Sources > Files` (the default when opening Dictionaries), click on `Add`

- Select the folder where you put all the dictionary files your downloaded

- Click on the `Recursive` checkbox next to the folder in the list, like below:

  <Image
    src={settingsImage}
    alt="Dictionaries settings"
    width="459"
    height="156"
  />

- Click `Apply`

- That's it!
  
  GoldenDict will now be indexing all the dictionaries,
  which might take a few minutes, but after that you're good to go,
  it won't be necessary to re-index in the future.
