The best way to use dictionaries offline in Windows is [**GoldenDict-ng**](https://xiaoyifang.github.io/goldendict-ng/).

:::note
`-ng` stands for _Next Generation_, since it's the revival of an older project called GoldenDict.

### What is GoldenDict-ng?

This is a **Dictionaries Lookup Program**, meaning that it doesn't rely on any one dictionary, but can read any number of dictionary **files** that you provide it.

In other words you can have your English-English, English-French, Tibetan-English and English-Spanish dictionaries all in the same place, or whatever language you might be interested in, and jump to and from one another with a single click.

With GoldenDict you can not only search for definitions in several dictionaries while offline, you'll also be able to define words from any applications by simply highlighting the text and pressing a hotkey (2x CTRL+C by default), like shown in the screenshot below.

  alt="GoldenDict popup definition window"
  width="480"
  height="406"
  class="pl-1 bg-[#3347ff]"
/>

As you can see, you'll be able to use dictionaries that support hyperlinks, like the excellent WordNet dictionary that offers synonyms, antonyms and the like for every definition.

### Installation

- Open [https://github.com/xiaoyifang/goldendict/releases/latest](https://github.com/xiaoyifang/goldendict/releases/latest)

- Go at the very bottom of the page

- Grab the installer by clicking on:

  - `6.x.x-GoldenDict-ng-Installer.exe` if you are running Windows 11 or your computer is somewhat recent.
  - `5.x.x-GoldenDict-ng-Installer.exe` if your computer is fairly old or if you have issues running the version above. This one should work no matter what.

    :::note
    replace `x.x` by whichever version happens to be the latest at the time
    :::

- Run it once downloaded

### Finding dictionaries

GoldenDict supports [more than 11 different types of dictionary **formats**](https://xiaoyifang.github.io/goldendict-ng/dictformats/), which will allow you use dictionaries found in many different places across the Internet.

:::note
I believe the format that is the most easy to come by is the **StarDict** format. Just ask Google for "StarDict" and the language of your choice and the odds are you'll quickly find what you're looking for.

:::tip
If you want ready-made packages of languages, just head over the [GoldenDict dictionaries](/dictionaries) section.

### Installing dictionaries

- Put all your dictionary files in one single folder. I personally gather them in `Documents/GoldenDict`

- Launch GoldenDict

- Click on `Edit > Dictionaries` or press `F3`

- In `Sources > Files` (the default when opening Dictionaries), click on `Add`

- Select the folder where you put all the dictionary files your downloaded

- Click on the `Recursive` checkbox next to the folder in the list, like below

- TODO

- Click `Apply`

- That's it! GoldenDict will now be indexing all the dictionaries, which might take a few minutes, but this will only have to be done the first time you add new dictionaries

### Adding new dictionaries at a later time

- Add your new dictionary files in the same folder you used above

- Return to `Edit > Dictionaries` or press `F3`

- Click `Rescan now`

- That's it!
